## 🖌 Overview

TeraCopy is designed to handle file transfer tasks with exceptional speed and precision. Unlike the default Windows copy function, it focuses on minimizing copy time while reducing the risk of corrupted files.  

The application integrates seamlessly into Windows Explorer, allowing users to drag and drop files or use right-click options for faster workflows. TeraCopy verifies files after transfer using checksums, ensuring that your data arrives without corruption or alteration.  

Professionals working with large datasets, media files, or critical backups benefit from its pause-and-resume function, which makes handling unstable drives or interrupted transfers effortless.  

TeraCopy also includes advanced error handling that skips problematic files without stopping the entire operation. A detailed report at the end provides insight into all successful and failed transfers, helping users stay informed.  

Its lightweight design means it uses minimal system resources, making it suitable for both low-end and high-performance PCs. Whether you’re a home user copying personal photos or an IT professional moving terabytes of data, TeraCopy ensures efficiency and reliability.  

This makes it one of the most trusted tools for anyone who values speed, integrity, and full control over file transfers.
